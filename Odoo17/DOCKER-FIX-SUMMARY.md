# Docker Entrypoint and Backup Script Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Docker Entrypoint Script
**Problem**: Containers failed with `exec /docker-entrypoint.sh: no such file or directory`

**Solution**: Updated `Dockerfile` to properly copy the scripts directory and set permissions:
```dockerfile
# Copy scripts directory
COPY --chown=root:root scripts/ /scripts/
RUN chmod +x /scripts/*.sh
```

### 2. Backup Script Path Issues
**Problem**: Backup containers failed with `exec /scripts/backup.sh: no such file or directory`

**Solution**: The `Dockerfile.backup` was already correctly configured to copy scripts to `/scripts/`. The issue was resolved by ensuring the Dockerfile copies scripts properly.

### 3. Docker Compose Configuration
**Solution**: Updated both `docker-compose.yml` files to:
- Mount scripts directory for development: `./scripts:/scripts:ro`
- Added backup service configuration with proper environment variables
- Used Docker profiles for backup service (`--profile backup`)

## How to Test the Fixes

### Method 1: Use the Test Script
```bash
./docker-test.sh
```

### Method 2: Manual Testing
```bash
# Navigate to Odoo directory
cd /home/deachawat/dev/projects/Odoo/Odoo17

# Rebuild containers
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs for errors
docker-compose logs odoo

# Test backup service
docker-compose --profile backup run --rm backup
```

### Method 3: Production Testing
```bash
# For production environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build --no-cache
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Dockerfile**: Added scripts directory copying and permission setting
2. **docker-compose.yml**: Added scripts volume mount and backup service
3. **docker-compose.prod.yml**: Already had proper backup configuration
4. **Dockerfile.backup**: Already correctly configured (no changes needed)

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:
- ✅ Odoo containers should start without entrypoint errors
- ✅ Backup containers should find scripts at `/scripts/backup.sh`
- ✅ Manual backup execution should work: `docker-compose --profile backup run --rm backup`
- ✅ Production backup service should run automatically

## Environment Variables for Backup

For production, ensure these environment variables are set:
```bash
POSTGRES_DB=your_db_name
POSTGRES_USER=your_db_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_db_password
BACKUP_DIR=/backup
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=7
```

## Additional Notes

- The backup service in development uses a profile (`backup`) so it won't start automatically
- To run backup manually: `docker-compose --profile backup run --rm backup`
- Production backup service runs continuously if configured in docker-compose.prod.yml
- All scripts are now properly copied to containers and have executable permissions
