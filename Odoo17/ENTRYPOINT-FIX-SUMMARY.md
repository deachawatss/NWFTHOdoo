# Docker Entrypoint Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
Fixed the persistent Docker entrypoint errors:
- `exec /docker-entrypoint.sh: no such file or directory`
- `exec /scripts/backup.sh: no such file or directory`

## Root Causes Found
1. **File Permission Issue**: `docker-entrypoint.sh` was not executable on the host machine
2. **Build Order Issue**: Scripts were copied after switching to non-root user in Dockerfile
3. **Ownership Issues**: Scripts needed proper permissions during Docker build

## Fixes Applied

### 1. File Permissions Fixed
```bash
chmod +x docker-entrypoint.sh
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

### 2. Dockerfile Build Order Fixed
**Before (Broken):**
```dockerfile
COPY --chown=odoo:odoo . .
COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /docker-entrypoint.sh
```

**After (Fixed):**
```dockerfile
# Copy entrypoint first as root
COPY docker-entrypoint.sh /docker-entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /docker-entrypoint.sh

# Copy scripts as root
COPY scripts/ /scripts/
RUN chmod +x /scripts/*.sh

# Then copy source code with odoo ownership
COPY --chown=odoo:odoo . .
```

### 3. Dockerfile.backup Fixed
- Ensured scripts are copied and made executable before switching users
- Fixed ownership chain for backup containers

## How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Use Test Script (Windows)
```cmd
test-docker-fix.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Testing
```bash
# Stop existing containers
docker-compose down

# Build with no cache
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs odoo
docker-compose logs backup
```

### Option 3: Quick Verification
```bash
./verify-setup.sh
```

## Expected Results After Fix
✅ No more "no such file or directory" errors  
✅ Odoo container starts successfully  
✅ Backup container starts successfully  
✅ All entrypoint scripts execute properly  

## Files Modified
- `Dockerfile` - Fixed script copying order
- `Dockerfile.backup` - Fixed backup script permissions
- `docker-entrypoint.sh` - Made executable
- `scripts/backup.sh` - Confirmed executable
- `scripts/restore.sh` - Confirmed executable

## Additional Tools Created
- `test-docker-fix.bat` - Windows test script
- `verify-setup.sh` - Setup verification script
- This documentation file

## Production Deployment
Your production setup is now ready:
1. Use `start-production.bat` to start on Windows server
2. All entrypoint issues are resolved
3. Both main Odoo and backup services will start properly

The containers should now start without any entrypoint errors!
