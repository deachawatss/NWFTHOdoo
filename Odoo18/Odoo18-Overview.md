## Framework & Core Changes

### Enhanced ORM Access Control
Odoo 18 introduces sophisticated access control mechanisms:

```python
# New access control methods
class MyModel(models.Model):
    _name = 'my.model'
    
    def check_access_rights(self, operation, raise_exception=True):
        """Enhanced access rights checking"""
        return super().check_access_rights(operation, raise_exception)
    
    def check_access_rule(self, operation):
        """New access rule validation"""
        return super().check_access_rule(operation)
    
    def has_access(self, operation, record_ids=None):
        """Combined access rights and rules checking"""
        return self._check_access_rights_and_rules(operation, record_ids)
```

### Environment Object Enhancements
The Environment object now provides direct access to translations:

```python
# Direct translation access from environment
@api.model

    def search_and_analyze(self, domain):
        """Optimized search with analysis"""
        # New search_fetch with advanced options
        records = self.search_fetch(
            domain,
            ['name', 'amount', 'date'],
            limit=1000,
            order='date desc'
        )
        
        # Enhanced aggregation
        total = self.read_group(
            domain,
            ['amount:sum'],
            ['date:month'],
            orderby='date:month'
        )
        
        return {
            'records': records,
