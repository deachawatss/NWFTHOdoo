## Core Implementation Details

### 1. Model Extensions

#### HR Employee (`hr_employee.py`)
**Key Methods:**
- `_get_department_manager_domain()`: Returns domain for manager visibility
- `_check_department_manager_access()`: Validates access permissions
- `get_manager_employees()`: Returns all employees managed by current user
- `get_department_statistics()`: Returns department statistics for dashboards

**Constraints:**
- `_check_department_manager_constraint()`: Ensures department managers have user accounts

#### HR Leave (`hr_leave.py`) 
**Key Methods:**
- `_get_department_leave_domain()`: Returns domain for leave visibility
- `_check_department_manager_leave_access()`: Validates leave access
- `action_approve()`: Override with access control validation
- `action_refuse()`: Override with access control validation
- `get_department_leave_statistics()`: Returns leave statistics
- `get_my_team_leaves()`: Returns managed team's leave requests
- `get_pending_approvals()`: Returns pending approvals for manager

**Constraints:**
- `_check_employee_department_access()`: Validates user can access employee records

### 2. Security Implementation

#### Record Rules (`hr_department_security.xml`)

**HR Employee Access:**
```xml
<!-- Department Manager Rule -->
domain_force="[
    '|',
        ('id', '=', user.employee_id.id),
        ('department_id.manager_id.user_id', '=', user.id)
]"

<!-- Regular User Rule -->
domain_force="[
    '|',
        ('id', '=', user.employee_id.id),
        '&',
            ('department_id', '=', user.employee_id.department_id.id),
            ('department_id', '!=', False)
]"
```

**HR Leave Access:**
```xml
<!-- Department Manager Rule -->
domain_force="[
    '|',
        ('employee_id.id', '=', user.employee_id.id),
        ('employee_id.department_id.manager_id.user_id', '=', user.id)
]"

<!-- Regular User Rule -->
domain_force="[('employee_id.id', '=', user.employee_id.id)]"
```

#### Security Groups
- **Department Manager Group**: Inherits HR User and Time Off User permissions
- **Access Rights**: Proper read/write/create permissions per group

### 3. Access Control Matrix

| User Type | Employee Records | Leave Requests | Leave Allocations | Departments |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| Department Manager | Own + Department Team | Own + Department Team | Own + Department Team (RO) | Managed Departments (RO) |
| Regular Employee | Own + Same Department | Own Only | Own Only (RO) | None |
| HR Manager | All (inherited) | All (inherited) | All (inherited) | All (inherited) |

### 4. Database-Level Security

**Record Rules Applied:**
- `hr.employee` model: 2 rules (manager + user)
- `hr.leave` model: 2 rules (manager + user)  
- `hr.leave.allocation` model: 2 rules (manager + user)
- `hr.department` model: 1 rule (manager access)

**Permission Structure:**
- Read: Granted based on department relationship
- Write: Restricted to authorized users only
- Create: Allowed with validation constraints
- Delete: Blocked for data integrity

### 5. Validation and Business Logic

#### Access Validation Methods
```python
# Employee access validation
def _check_department_manager_access(self):
    # Returns True/False based on access rights

# Leave access validation  
def _check_department_manager_leave_access(self):
    # Returns True/False based on leave access rights
```

#### Constraint Validation
```python
# Department manager constraint
@api.constrains('department_id')
def _check_department_manager_constraint(self):
    # Ensures proper department-manager relationships

# Employee access constraint
@api.constrains('employee_id')  
def _check_employee_department_access(self):
    # Validates user access to employee records
```

### 6. Integration Points

#### Dependencies
- **hr**: Core HR functionality
- **hr_holidays**: Time off management

#### Inheritance Pattern
- **Delegation Inheritance**: Used for `hr.employee` and `hr.leave` models
- **No Core Modifications**: All changes through proper inheritance
- **Upgrade Safe**: Compatible with future Odoo updates

#### API Methods
```python
# Department statistics for dashboards
hr_employee.get_department_statistics()
hr_leave.get_department_leave_statistics()

# Management utilities
hr_employee.get_manager_employees()  
hr_leave.get_my_team_leaves()
hr_leave.get_pending_approvals()
```

### 7. Error Handling

#### Exception Types
- **ValidationError**: For constraint violations
- **AccessError**: For unauthorized operations
- **UserError**: For business logic violations

#### Error Messages
- Localized using `_()` function
- Descriptive error context provided
- Employee and department information included

### 8. Performance Considerations

#### Database Optimization
- **Record Rules**: Applied at database level (efficient)
- **Domain Filters**: Use indexed fields (user_id, employee_id, department_id)
- **Lazy Loading**: Methods use search() for on-demand data loading

#### Scalability
- **O(1) Complexity**: User access checks are constant time
- **Efficient Queries**: Domain filters use proper indexes
- **Minimal Overhead**: No significant performance impact

### 9. Testing Strategy

#### Manual Testing
- Department manager can see only their team
- Leave requests filtered by department
- Access denied for unauthorized operations
- Approval/rejection works correctly

#### Automated Testing (Recommended)
```python
# Test cases to implement:
def test_department_manager_employee_access(self)
def test_department_leave_visibility(self)  
def test_unauthorized_access_denied(self)
def test_leave_approval_authorization(self)
```

### 10. Deployment Requirements

#### System Requirements
- **Odoo Version**: 18.0+
- **Base Modules**: hr, hr_holidays
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (record rules require proper SQL support)

#### Configuration Requirements
- Departments must have managers assigned
- Managers must have user accounts
- Users must have proper security group assignments
- Employee records must have department assignments

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth
1. **Database Level**: Record rules filter data at SQL level
2. **ORM Level**: Model methods validate access
3. **Business Logic**: Action methods check authorization  
4. **UI Level**: Views respect record rule filtering
5. **API Level**: All access goes through validation layers

### Security Principles Applied
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users see only necessary data
- **Separation of Duties**: Different access levels per role
- **Data Integrity**: Constraints prevent invalid states
- **Audit Trail**: All operations logged by Odoo framework
- **Fail Secure**: Deny access by default, grant explicitly

This implementation provides comprehensive department-based access control while maintaining Odoo best practices and security standards.
